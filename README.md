## AI-powered healthcare technology company based in New York City
<https://flatiron.com/>
--- 
### The company specializes in cancer research and healthcare technology, focusing on improving treatment outcomes and accelerating research through its oncology-specific software and data platforms.

* Flatiron Health | Reimagining the infrastructure of cancer care.

* Flatiron Health was incorporated in 2012.
  
* Was incorporated by  Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg.

[The idea for Flatiron Health emerged from the personal experiences of its co-founders, Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg, who were childhood friends and had previously founded a successful advertising technology company, Invite Media. After selling Invite Media to Google in 2010, the duo began looking for their next venture.](<https://flatiron.com/>)

 The inspiration for Flatiron came when Nat Turner’s cousin was diagnosed with cancer. This personal connection exposed the co-founders to the inefficiencies and fragmented nature of the healthcare system, particularly in oncology. They noticed a lack of robust data integration and actionable insights in cancer care, which made it difficult for doctors, researchers, and patients to access meaningful information for treatment and research. 

* Turner and Weinberg saw an opportunity to apply their expertise in technology and data to create a platform that could aggregate and analyze real-world oncology data. This vision led to the founding of Flatiron Health in 2012, with a mission to improve cancer care and accelerate research through data-driven solutions.

**Flatiron Health has been funded through a combination of venture capital investments and an acquisition by Roche, a global healthcare and pharmaceutical company.**


 Funding Overview:
Seed and Series A (2012-2013):
Flatiron Health initially raised a seed round of $8 million in 2012.
In 2013, they closed a $13 million Series A funding round, led by Google Ventures (now GV).

* Series B (2014):
The company raised $130 million in a Series B funding round, which included Google Ventures, First Round Capital, and others. This round significantly accelerated their growth.

* Acquisition by Roche (2018):
In February 2018, Roche acquired Flatiron Health for $1.9 billion, solidifying Roche's commitment to personalized healthcare and real-world evidence in oncology. Roche had previously made a minority investment in Flatiron, and the full acquisition allowed Flatiron to expand its research and data initiatives while maintaining its independent operations.

>Overall, before the Roche acquisition, Flatiron had raised approximately $143 million in venture capital funding.
